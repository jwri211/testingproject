PROBLEM:
File "C:\Users\johnn\PycharmProjects\testingproject\venv\TestBowlingGame.py", line 13, in testGutterGame
    self.game.rolls(0)
TypeError: 'list' object is not callable

SOLUTION:
Code was trying to apply a score by just calling the list. Changed self.game.rolls(0) to self.game.rolls.append(0)
this means the loop appends a 0 to the rolls list on each iteration.


PROBLEM:
 File "C:\Users\johnn\PycharmProjects\testingproject\venv\BowlingGame.py", line 20, in score
    result += self.StrikeScore(rollIndex) #calculate the strike score and add to result.
AttributeError: 'BowlingGame' object has no attribute 'StrikeScore'

SOLUTION:
Method was incorrectly named. Corrected a spelling error in the method name to 'strikeScore'
and changed the method call above to use a lower case first letter.


PROBLEM:
Assertion Error for Test case 1: Assertion falied when game score should be zero.

SOLUTION:
Refactor the 'score' method. Added missing line to check of score was a strike, and correctly indented following code.
